The purpose of the project was to create a work day scheduler.

I have the a html file, css file, a js file, and a readme file.
index3.html
script.js
styles.css

-I found the moment API challenging to work with, but I got some help with tutoring, which helped me get the API and my JS coding going.
-The day time scheduler should function as intended with text boxes and save function in each time slot.
